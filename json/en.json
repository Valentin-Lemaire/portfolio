            "intro": "My name is Valentin Lemaire, I'm 18 years old, and I'm from Lyon, France.",
            "education": "I'm a second-year engineering student at <a href='https://www.ece.fr/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>ECE Lyon</a>, specializing in <strong>computer science</strong>.",
            "learning": "I started coding at home in 2021, learning most of my technical skills independently. The only exceptions are Python, which I studied during my final year of high school, and low-level programming (C), which I learned in my first year of engineering. My front-end web development skills are entirely self-taught.",
            "experience": "Teaching myself to code has been both a challenge and a rewarding journey. I know that learning in the field of engineering never truly stops, as technology constantly evolves. However, through this experience, I've developed valuable skills for an engineer to have: the ability to <strong>learn independently</strong> and <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>. Speaking of self-taught skills, I've become great at <strong>popularization</strong> concerning complex subjects which is, in my opinion, an important skill for an engineer to have when working with non-technical people.",
            "interests": "By the way, to share a bit more about my interests and passions, I have a strong interest in science and technology. My two favorite fields are <strong>computer science</strong> and <strong>aerospace</strong>, that's why I'm truly glad to be studying engineering, it's something I'm genuinely passionate about."
